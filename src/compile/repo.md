# Local repository setup and maintenance
This section describes the initial setup and routine maintenance of your local repository

# Initial setup

## Download source code

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/veloren/veloren.git
```

See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) if you cloned the repo before Git LFS was setup

Change your working directory to the cloned repository  
```
cd veloren
```

**All commands** in this chapter from now on should be executed from there.

# Basic repo navigation

## Changing branches

In order to try out new unmerged or unfinished features, you may want to switch to a different branch.

To switch to a developement branch
```
git checkout <branch_name>
```

To switch back to master
```
git checkout master
```

## Updating

To download the latest changes and update your current branch
```
git pull
```

To download the latest changes without merging them into your local branch
```
git fetch
```

## The help command 

Git also offers a help command with detailed information about other commands
```
git help <optional subcommand name>
```

## Modifying the source code

If you want to modify the source code, refer to [contributing](../contribute/README.md) chapter.

To discard changes you've made to the source code
```
git reset --hard
```
Keep in mind that this deletes all the changes **without a way to recover them**.

To discard your changes with ability to restore them later
```
git stash
```

To restore stashed changes
```
git stash pop
```

# Maintenance

This section covers common operations used to keep your local copy working properly.

## Cleaning old build files

Over time as dependencies get updated, the old compiled versions start to take up a lot of space. To delete them type
```
cargo clean
```
Keep in mind that cargo will need to recompile all dependencies which can take a long time.

## Updating the toolchain

To update the rust toolchain
```
rustup update
```
