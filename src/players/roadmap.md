# Roadmap

Veloren's development process is naturally open-ended and guided by its community: new features get added as and when
there is consensus within the community. Veloren's development is a constant process of re-evaluation and incremental
improvement, with contributors working on the features that most interest them. For this reason, the project doesn't
have a precise roadmap!

That said, there are a number of features and objectives we'd like to see implemented before the game leaves 'alpha'
status:

## Roleplaying and character development

- More passive skills and abilities (fishing, metallurgy, farming, animal taming, etc.)

- More horizontal progression, allowing players to specialise in many different ways and build up a character that
  reflects their preferred style of play

- A wider variety of weapons, tools, and skills

## World and simulation

- More detailed world simulation: NPC and player factions, rich history generation, diplomacy, simulated economics that
  respond to player actions, sieges, wars, etc. all simulated in real-time during normal gameplay

- Improved world generation: a wider variety of geographic features, procedural locations, biomes, and a 'layered' world
  (many co-existing layers within the same world space such as caves, the overworld, canopy layers, etc.)

- Detailed world ecology: simulation of animal populations, plant growth, and changing world geography. A Veloren world
  should evolve with, and in response to, the actions of players

## Questing and interaction

- Better dialogue options with NPCs that feel like they're active participants in the world, not simply props

- Quests that are procedurally generated in response to the state of the world and that have a meaningful impact on the
  state of the world: player actions should influence the world

- Player-created quests, player bounties, etc.

## Multiplayer

- Improved efficiency of the game (and in particular, the server) with the long-term goal of hosting 1,000 players on a
  single server at once

# Out of scope (for now)

There are a few features that we're like to see eventually, but that we don't consider to be essential for a beta
release.

- Server federations, where servers can opt in to sharing characters and economies in a 'circle of trust', allowing for
  truly enormous player-driven economies
