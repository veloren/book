# Development Philosophy

## 🔭 Wide scope

Veloren's world is large and extensive and we encourage many different ways to play the game, as well as diverse
elements that enrich the experience. There is no single, specific goal or focus and we believe it would hurt the wider
community if one was introduced.

## 🗽 Player freedom

Where possible, avoid 'invisible walls' (both literal and metaphorical) that arbitrarily break consistency and limit
what players can do. If limitations need to exist for technical, balance, gameplay, or moderation reasons then attempt
to find in-world justification for those limitations.

## 🧩 Modularity and extensibility

Where possible and where doing so does not place dramatic limitations on future development, Veloren should attempt to
be modular such that disparate components of the project can be reused and integrated into diverse settings. Where
possible, features should be small, self-correcting, rugged, and able to operate in diverse environments (a great
example of this is the Controller/Agent/CharacterState code, which generalises to all players, NPCs, and even
non-sentient entities).

## 🫱🏼‍🫲🏾 Community-driven

Development should occur in dialogue with the community. While Veloren is inevitably steered by those most active
members, it is important to take into account feedback from the periphery: less active developers, moderators, artists,
players, as well as third parties such as downstream consumers of the software produced by the project. Veloren should
actively resist attempts to turn the project into a for-profit venture, with fundraising and finance used wisely with
the primary aim of enhancing the core project, player experience, and upstream/downstream projects.

## 🗺 Teleological

Veloren emphasises gameplay and systems that emerge out of the application of simple, physically-based rules where
possible. Systems should be simple, interconnected, self-balancing, and simple in isolation: complex and interesting
behaviour should emerge through the interaction between systems rather than arising due to complexity within any single
system.
