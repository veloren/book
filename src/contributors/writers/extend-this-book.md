### Common elements

Consistency is key. Therefore here are common elements used in the book and how they should be styled:

---

content

**Note:** _Highlight important notice which the reader should keep in mind._

---

Short description for experienced people

> More detailed description for beginners and newcomers.

---

Use `<br/>` for linebreaks.

---

Rust syntax highlighting works good for `.ron` files. (Use `rust,ignore` to avoid making them runnable)

```rust,ignore
Brown: (
    vox_spec: ("armor.chest.grayscale", (-7.0, -3.5, 2.0)),
    color: Some((90, 49, 43))
),
```

**Tip:** notice which can help reduce time and effort.
