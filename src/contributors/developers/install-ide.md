# Installing an IDE

Before being able to comfortably modify Rust code you will need to install an IDE.

**TIP**: Checkout the [rust tools](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools) page to find common IDEs which support Rust and install
the respective plugins.

After that you can type

```
cargo run
```

in the console to start Veloren in debug mode.

**Note**: _The initial compilation will take from 5min up to 30min therefore grab a tea and some snacks and come back later._

If you want get familiar with cargo we recommend the [Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).
