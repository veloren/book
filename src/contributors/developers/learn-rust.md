# Learning Rust

There are [a lot](https://github.com/ctjhoa/rust-learning) of resources to learn about Rust.

For the basics we recommend taking a look at [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and
[the cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/).

After that you can start familiarizing yourself with [the codebase](codebase-structure.md).
