# Installing tools

In order to compile Veloren, you'll need to install a few things.

## Rust

Rust can be easily installed on all major desktop operating systems. Follow this link for installation instructions specific to your system.

Because Veloren uses the nightly version of Rust, please make sure you install it.

## Git

There are many ways to install Git. For those running Linux, your system probably has Git already installed or available to install with your chosen package manager.

You also need to make sure you have Git LFS installed. This allows us to store large files like images and audio files.

For Windows, The ['Git for Windows'](https://gitforwindows.org/) suite is a sensible way to install Git, along with a set of tools that'll make it easier for you to use.

*For Mac OS, there exists other methods. I personally have not used Mac OS, so you'll likely have a better time finding instructions just by searching for 'Install Git on Mac OS'. If someone wants to contribute appropriate instructions to this page, please do.*
